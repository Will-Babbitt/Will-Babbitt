            <h1>The Beauty of Simple Web Design</h1>
            <p class="meta">November 5, 2025</p>
            
            <p>In a world of React, Vue, and complex build processes, there's something refreshing about building a website with just HTML and CSS.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Simple?</h2>
            <p>Modern web frameworks are powerful, but they're not always necessary. For a personal website or blog, simple HTML and CSS offer several advantages:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> No JavaScript framework means faster load times</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Works on any browser, even old ones</li>
                <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> HTML from 20 years ago still works today</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to understand and maintain</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Web is Already Powerful</h2>
            <p>HTML and CSS have evolved tremendously. With modern CSS features like flexbox, grid, and custom properties, you can create beautiful, responsive layouts without any JavaScript at all.</p>
            
            <p>Sometimes the best tool is the simplest one that gets the job done.</p>
