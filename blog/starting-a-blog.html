                I want to maintain a blog. I like the idea of it as a project within itself. I have yet to decide how public I want to make this or who exactly my intended audience is, but I believe in the idea of documenting projects and the accountability that creates in finishing them.

                Ironically this is not the first post on the blog, but I suppose it helps to have an example to point to. My previous <a href="dotfiles.html">dotfiles post</a> is an example of the kinds of things I want to post on this blog. I am sure this will evolve over time, but on the off set I want to use this blog to document projects that I am working on for my own reference as well as building out my personal website.
