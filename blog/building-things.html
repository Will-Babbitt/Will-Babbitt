            <h1>On Building Things</h1>
            <p class="meta">November 10, 2025</p>
            
            <p>There's something deeply satisfying about building things from scratch. Whether it's code, furniture, or even a simple website, the process of taking an idea and turning it into something real is incredibly rewarding.</p>
            
            <h2>The Joy of Creation</h2>
            <p>When you build something yourself, you understand it completely. Every decision, every trade-off, every little detail is yours. You know why things are the way they are because you made them that way.</p>
            
            <p>This understanding creates a connection to your work that's hard to achieve any other way.</p>
            
            <h2>Starting Simple</h2>
            <p>I've found that the best projects often start with the simplest possible version. Add complexity only when you need it, not because you think you might need it someday.</p>
            
            <p>This website is a perfect example - just HTML and CSS, nothing more complicated than necessary.</p>
